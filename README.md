# Bachelor's Thesis: Splitting Methods and Exponential Integrators for Parabolic Differential Equations

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and full thesis for the numerical study of **splitting methods** and **exponential integrators** applied to **parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs)**. The methods leverage the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for efficient computation of linear terms and time integration.

## Contents

- 📄 `thesis.pdf` – Full PDF of the bachelor's thesis
- 📁 `code/` – MATLAB scripts implementing the numerical methods
- 🔬 Sample simulations and visualizations

## Requirements

- MATLAB (recommended: R2021a or newer)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (may be required for FFT operations)

## How to Run

The main simulation script is located in the `code/` folder.

```matlab
main.m
