# Bachelor's Thesis: Splitting Methods and Exponential Integrators for Parabolic Differential Equations

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation and full thesis for the numerical study of **splitting methods** and **exponential integrators** applied to **parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs)**. The methods leverage the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for efficient computation of linear terms and time integration.
